applescript-nhs-calendar
========================

This script is a work in progress, used to automatically enter the events of NHS's calendar into my iCal/Fantastical calendar each week. NHS operates on what is essentially a two-day rotation, so each week's schedule is opposite the last week's. Exceptions occur whenever there's a snow day or a day off. Rather than input all of this information at the beginning of the year (which would take a really long time and need to be changed periodically), I run this script each week and fill in my calendar based on which day of the rotation occurs at the start of the week.
